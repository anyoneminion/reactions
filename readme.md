# FAQ

**Q: "Something isn't working"**

A: First of all, make sure you're using the most up to date version of my reactions
Secondly, make sure your debug logs are ENABLED. Check the debug tab in the TensorReactions window and enable it.
Finally, send me the debug log, located in TensorReactions/logs in your minion folder, along with a description
of your problem. Try to be as precise as possible with the issue.
Additionally, if it's a rotational error, send me the link to the fflogs of the run in question.
You can reach me on discord at Anyone#9549.

**Q: My reactions aren't loading or going off?**

A: To be safe, after placing these files in the above folder, reload your LUA, then go to the TensorReactions menu, while on the respective class select each raid and make sure the profile for the class you're on is selected. If you're on machinist, select the machinist profiles, the next time you load into that raid on machinist, that profile will load. If you're having any issues beyond this, ask for help in rikudou's discord.
